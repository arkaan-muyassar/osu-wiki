   - *Notice: While this competition has been planned as a 3 versus 3 setup, this might change depending on the amount of registrations.*
2. Beatmap scoring will be based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the Mappool Selector Team on the Sunday before the actual matches take place.
   - Each mappool, except for the Qualifier stage, will contain a *tiebreaker* beatmap. It will only be played in case of a tie in the scoreline in the *best of* system, e.g. the scoreline is 4-4 and the match is best of 9, the tiebreaker shall be played.
4. Match schedule will be handled by the Tournament Management.
5. If no referees are available at match time, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a beatmap is considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay mechanics.
8. If a game ends in a draw it will be nullified and the beatmap replayed, herein called a *rematch*.
9. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
   - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
10. Beatmaps must not be reused in the same match, except for rematches.
11. **The maximum size for a team is 6 players, and the minimum is 4.**
    - This might change depending on the amount of registrations.
12. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, it can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with the most members present.
    - The minimum amount of required players is defined as the amount of players needed to play a beatmap.
13. Exchanging players during games is allowed without limitations.
14. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied.
15. If a player disconnects between beatmaps and the team cannot provide a substitute, the match can be delayed for up to 10 minutes (limited to once per team, per match).
16. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and the Tournament Management are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
17. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting and provoking other players or staff, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited.
18. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
    - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate at multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
19. Unexpected incidences will be handled by the Tournament Management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
20. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
    - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments, until appealed.
21. The Tournament Management reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.
